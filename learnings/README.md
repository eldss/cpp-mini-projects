This directory contains insights and knowledge gained during the development of the C++ mini-projects. It serves as a reference for important concepts, patterns, and techniques encountered throughout the journey.

## Structure

The repository is organized by topic areas:

```
learnings/
├── cpp/              # C++ language features and best practices
├── linux/            # Linux-specific knowledge
│   ├── filesystem.md
│   └── ...
├── systems/          # General systems programming concepts
├── tools/            # Development tools and environment
└── algorithms/       # Algorithms and data structures
```

## Purpose

This knowledge base aims to:

1. Document key insights for future reference
2. Reinforce learning through documentation
3. Create a searchable repository of practical knowledge
4. Track progress and growth throughout the projects

Feel free to reference and expand these documents as new concepts are encountered.
