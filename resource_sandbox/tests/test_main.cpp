// This file is the main entry point for the Catch2 test framework
// It's intentionally minimal - actual tests will be added in separate files

// This define is needed only in one file to create the test runner
#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN
#include <catch2/catch_all.hpp>

// No test cases in this file - they will be in separate files
// This keeps compilation times faster when adding new tests
